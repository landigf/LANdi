# LANdi Manifesto

LANdi is something I am building to learn how real systems work.  
It is my way to study networking, distributed systems, and software design by creating
small, clear components that behave like servers, clients, and routers inside a local network.

I want to understand things by building them, not just by reading about them.
The goal is not to make a perfect tool, but a simple and reusable one that helps
me and others experiment and learn.

Here are my intentions:

1. Keep things clear ->
   I will try to make every part of the project easy to read and easy to understand.
   Simple code is better than clever code.

2. Learn by doing ->
   I will start from naive solutions, then improve them step by step.
   Each step should teach me something new about design or performance.

3. Reuse what I build ->
   When something works well, I will make it reusable, so the next time
   I (or someone else) can build faster and learn from it.

4. Make it observable ->
   Everything that happens inside LANdi should be visible:
   packets, requests, delays, queues. Seeing things helps me learn.

5. Write things down ->
   I will document not only what I did, but why I did it and what I learned.
   Even short notes are useful when you look back later.

6. Share the learning ->
   LANdi is open-source because I hope it can help other students
   who want to understand how systems behave without getting lost in complexity.

This project is a learning path.  
If someone else learns something from it too, that means I did it right.
